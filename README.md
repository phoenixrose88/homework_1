- Added attributes to make images more accessible and user-friendly

## Installation

- Right click on file to open the 'index.html' file in your default browser

To clone the project type the following as separate commands in your terminal:

_As you can see the functioning and the appearance of the website remains the same after refactoring the HTML and CSS, hence nothing is broken._
